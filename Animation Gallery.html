	<p><span class="firstchar">I </span> have compiled a collection of my ongoing Animation work here. I have work going back through the last several years, and it will be updated as I complete and format more material. I produce new work over time, and am currently working on updating the work visible on the site, so if you would like to see more it is most likely available upon request.</p>
		<p>If you like what you see, my contact information is located at the bottom of every page: Feel free to drop a line! Whether it be to discuss freelancing work or just to discuss style and experiences, I would love to hear from you.

      <h3>Gavin the Clown</h3>
      <p>Gavin the clown was creepy for me, even as I modeled him. I have here the images of him with texture, and you can find his turnaround in the show reel video above.</p>

      <p>Claude and cerule are featured in my illustration Gallery as designs. Theyre very simple, but the style was very fun to sculpt!</p>

      <h3>Hades and Persephone</h3>
      <p>This, while not 3D, showcases an animatic type storyboard presentation. I wanted to give it a motion-graphics cutout feel. I drew inspiration from the company Supergiant games Transistor and Pyre. This style would be ideal for presentations.</p>

      <h3>Fish Tank Sim</h3>
      <p>An Aquarium made in Cinema 4D. The tank is sparse because I was really focused on making the glass and water believeable. The fish are textured as a school, and there is a towel showing cloth dynamics. It looks like its seen better days!</p>

      <h3>Chickens! A Feathered Tail</h3>
      <p>I created this film with my own experience at heart. I have a baby sister 19 years younger than me, and she was quite the surprise. At first, I was simply excited about the cute new baby that was coming into my life- but I very quickly realized that having a tiny human around was a lot of work. This short film is about just that: Responsibility. </p>
