	<p><span class="firstchar">I </span> have compiled a collection of my ongoing Animation work here. I have work going back through the last several years, and it will be updated as I complete and format more material. I produce new work over time, and am currently working on updating the work visible on the site, so if you would like to see more it is most likely available upon request.</p>
		<p>If you like what you see, my contact information is located at the bottom of every page: Feel free to drop a line! Whether it be to discuss freelancing work or just to discuss style and experiences, I would love to hear from you.

      <p>Gavin the clown was creepy for me, even as I modeled him. I have here the images of him with texture, and you can find his turnaround in the show reel video above.</p>

      <h3>Hades and Persephone</h3>
      <p>This, while not 3D, showcases an animatic type storyboard presentation. I wanted to give it a motion-graphics cutout feel. I drew inspiration from the company Supergiant games Transistor and Pyre. This style would be ideal for presentations.</p>

      <p>A drawing I did during one of my online streams. One of my viewers submitted photos of himself during a stream where I was taking drawing requests. I wanted to keep the essential features, but augment them to make the drawing more playful.</p>

      <p>A drawing I did during one of my online streams. I wanted her to be bright, and show off the advantages of a monotone color palette, a "blue period" piece, if you will. I enjoyed drawing her, and would like to create a character sheet for her someday as a personal project. </p>

      <p>I wanted to capture the nymph Daphne of Greek myth at the moment before her transformation into a laurel tree. I wanted to capture her as afraid, on the run and looking over her shoulder, but mild in nature. </p>

      <p>A friendly service android. She is made to serve tea at a cafe, and even contains tea in a tank in her stomach. Each model is labelled according to a type of tea, and they are very coveted in their establishments. </p>

      <h3>Venti, as a female</h3>
      <p>The original character and design credit goes to Mihoyo and Genshin Impact, but I wanted to redraw one of their characfters enhancing the more feminine aspects. The character is made to be very feminine/childlike, but is portrayed as male, and I wanted to see how he would look if they went the extra mile. </p>
