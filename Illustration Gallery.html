      <h3>Cerule Design</h3>
      <p>I wanted to make a character design for a webcomic that embodied a fairytale princess, but in sketch form. Cerule is the princess of Ballpoint Fen, a fantasy world within the realm of of a young boy's sketchbook.</p>

      <h3>Jinx Portrait</h3>
      <p>Jinx, or "Powder" from Arcane. I was inspired by the animation in the show Arcane when it came out, and decided to draw a version of the character mimicking my own style. I wanted to find a medium ground between the style featured in the show that made it so unique, and my own style.</p>

      <h3>Sleep Well Illustration</h3>
      <p>I illustrated a book for Brandy Champeau of Exploring Expression homeschooling called "Sleep Well, Child of God". This was one of the images I created for that book. The image was made to repesent the spirit of freedom, and passing of that spirit from the ancestors of the child to the present day.</p>

      <h3>Portrait of a friend</h3>
      <p>A drawing I did during one of my online streams. One of my viewers submitted photos of himself during a stream where I was taking drawing requests. I wanted to keep the essential features, but augment them to make the drawing more playful.</p>

      <h3>Friendly Mermaid</h3>
      <p>A drawing I did during one of my online streams. I wanted her to be bright, and show off the advantages of a monotone color palette, a "blue period" piece, if you will. I enjoyed drawing her, and would like to create a character sheet for her someday as a personal project. </p>

      <h3>Daphne in Transformation</h3>
      <p>I wanted to capture the nymph Daphne of Greek myth at the moment before her transformation into a laurel tree. I wanted to capture her as afraid, on the run and looking over her shoulder, but mild in nature. </p>

      <h3>Lady Grey</h3>
      <p>A friendly service android. She is made to serve tea at a cafe, and even contains tea in a tank in her stomach. Each model is labelled according to a type of tea, and they are very coveted in their establishments. </p>

      <h3>Venti, as a female</h3>
      <p>The original character and design credit goes to Mihoyo and Genshin Impact, but I wanted to redraw one of their characfters enhancing the more feminine aspects. The character is made to be very feminine/childlike, but is portrayed as male, and I wanted to see how he would look if they went the extra mile. </p>
